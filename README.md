In Sustain-a-city, you are tasked with creating humanity's last city, protected from extreme pollution by a large dome equipped with an air filter. To ensure your city's survival, you must make sustainable decisions that balance pollution levels, economic health, energy demands and population happiness. 

You'll have access to various unique assets, each with its own impact on your city. To succeed in creating a sustainable city, you will have to use them wisely!

Installation Guide
1) Download the 'Sustain-a-City.zip' file from the Releases tab in the \href{https://github.com/Filippo-Santiano/SECW2/releases}{GitHub repository.}
2) Extract the .zip file using Windows Explorer or a tool such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.

Quick Start Guide

Get started in 9 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select \textbf{"Start Game"} from the Main Menu.
    \item Read the introductory information to understand your mission. 
    \item Begin building your city by opening the \textbf{building menu} in the bottom-right corner.
    \item Select an asset you can afford (your starting money is Â£175). Since income is essential, a \hyperref[revenue]{revenue-generating asset} is a good first choice.
    \item Place the selected asset on the map. 
    \item Keep building your city by repeating steps 3-5, using different assets to maintain a balance between pollution, economy, electricity and happiness.
    \item Over time, some assets may require repairing. Click on any placed asset and, if you have enough money, press the repair button. You will also need to repair your protective dome's air filter, which keeps external pollution out.
    \item As your city grows, keep an eye on your pollution, it cannot exceed 1000 for more than 3 years. If this happens, you will lose the game.
    \item When the game ends, you'll receive a score that reflects the sustainability of your city.
    % Something about the score?
